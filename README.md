# RSS feeds

Not one of your awesome lists, just my personal subscriptions.
Some of them a bit random, but mostly that's just some dev blogs. Couple in Russian, though (I think that's literally two of them?).
Not much to see here now, but will update the list over time. Maybe you'll find something useful too!

# By the way

I'm using [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) as my main RSS feed reader and pretty happy about it.
Besides RSS feeds it can handle email subscriptions (providing email address), has read later functionality, actions/filters, etc.
So give it a try maybe? Or tell me what you're using!

# If you're looking for some curated lists

Have a look at this one: [personal-websites-RSS](https://github.com/matthiasott/personal-websites-RSS)
It obviously contains personal blogs, but they're the hardest to find, right?
